# Data Model

## Entities

### Trip
A travel opportunity that groups multiple bookings in the same geographic area. Consolidates bookings, expenses, and profitability tracking for a single journey.

### Booking
A confirmed gig at a specific venue. Bookings can originate from converted Leads or be added manually. Each booking belongs to a Trip.

### Expense
Costs associated with a trip, such as travel, lodging, meals, and other trip-related expenses. Includes revenue split tracking to calculate net profitability.

### Participant
Attendees or singers participating in a booking. Used to track who's attending specific events.

### Campaign
A lead discovery effort around a specific location. Campaigns scrape multiple sources (ChoralNet, CASA, Facebook, Instagram, Google API) to discover potential booking opportunities.

### Lead
A discovered opportunity (chorus, a cappella group, or music organization) that could convert into a Booking. Generated by Campaigns and can be nurtured through outreach.

### Venue
The actual group, chorus, or music organization where bookings take place. Separate from individual contact persons to maintain organizational information.

### Contact
A person at a venue or organization you communicate with. Contacts are associated with Venues and receive outreach messages.

### EmailSequence
An automated follow-up flow for converting leads through the complete sales funnel: cold outreach → nurturing interested leads → booking confirmation → logistics follow-up.

### Message
An individual email or SMS sent to leads or confirmed groups. Messages belong to EmailSequences or can be sent as one-off communications.

### Template
Reusable message or email templates for outreach. Templates are used to create consistent Messages across campaigns.

### GroupRequest

### ServiceOffering
