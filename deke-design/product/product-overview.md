# Coach OS

## Description
Coach OS is a dual-purpose platform for traveling coaches and their communities. On the business side, it optimizes travel by discovering nearby booking opportunities, managing expenses, and automating outreach. On the community side, it offers personal services like "Find a Singing Group" through Harmony, an AI chat agent that converts visitors into engaged community members and clients.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Wasted Travel Opportunities
When you book a gig in Montreal, Coach OS automatically discovers choruses, a cappella groups, and music organizations nearby, turning a single booking into a full weekend of revenue.

### Problem 2: Manual Lead Research is Time-Consuming
Instead of spending hours searching directories and social media, Coach OS scrapes multiple sources (ChoralNet, CASA, Facebook, Instagram, Google API) to build a qualified lead list instantly.

### Problem 3: Trip Management is Scattered and Clunky
A streamlined, mobile-optimized dashboard consolidates bookings, leads, expenses, and profitability calculations in one place - reducing screens and simplifying workflows.

### Problem 4: Following Up with Leads Takes Too Much Time
Automated email sequences handle the complete funnel: cold outreach to discovered groups, nurturing interested leads, booking confirmations, and logistics follow-up.

### Problem 5: Expense Tracking and Revenue Splits are Complex
Built-in expense management tracks all trip costs, calculates revenue splits with venues/hosts, shows net profitability per trip, and generates reports for accounting.

### Problem 6: Singers Don't Know How to Find Groups
The "Find a Singing Group" service (promoted at every concert) offers personal help matching singers with local groups. Simple intake form, personal response from the coach, builds community goodwill and positions the coach as a servant leader.

### Problem 7: Website Visitors Need Personal Guidance
Harmony, the resourceful AI chat agent, engages visitors, answers questions, collects information, and converts interest into bookings or service requests.
